## **About Wattson:**

Wattson is a smart plug that measures electricity usage for better decision-making in consumption habits. The user can see in real time, the cost of their consumption habits. Our prediction tool helps users adjust habits to optimize on costs and environmental impact for their household.  

Wattson is a hardware/software IoT solution consisting of a smart-plug and mobile application. The smart plug component sits between the electrical appliance and the wall plug and constantly measures the electrical usage of the appliance. Data is then sent directly over wifi, even when the app is not currently running.

The Wattson app reads the usage data in real-time, allowing the user to make decisions based on real-time information on their electrical usage habits, such as the number of activations and running time of certain appliances, as well as estimations about future trends and costs. 
Wattson also allows the user to see their usage history. In addition to daily data, each appliance usage can show but also weekly, monthly and yearly usage habits!
