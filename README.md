## About Wattson:

Wattson is composed of 2 main parts, a smart plug, and a mobile application.
The Wattson smart plug component sits between the electrical appliance and the wall plug and constantly measures the electrical usage of the appliance.
Every measurement is sent directly to the database over wifi, even when the app is not currently running.

The Wattson app reads the usage data from the database in real-time, allowing the user to be presented with real-time information about their electrical usage habits, such as the number of activations and running time of certain appliances, as well as estimations about future trends and costs. 
Wattson also allows the user to see their usage history. Each appliance's usage can be expanded to show not only daily data but also weekly, monthly and yearly data!
